# API Reference

Conventions: REST + JSON, errors as `{ "error": { "code", "message" } }`
(validation failures → `400 VALIDATION`), realtime over WebSocket at `/ws`.
Auth uses `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; tokens are opaque, DB-backed
sessions valid for 12 hours.

CORS is enabled (`@fastify/cors`, origin reflected) so browser-based clients
on other origins — including the Tauri desktop webview (`tauri://localhost`),
which is a different origin from `http://localhost:3300` — can call the API
directly. The desktop app therefore always targets the local Node server at
its API base (`VITE_API_TARGET` at build time, default `http://localhost:3300`);
the Vite dev proxy is only a convenience for `pnpm dev:web` / `dev:desktop`.

## Health

### `GET /api/health`

Probe used by clients to confirm the local server is up. Public.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.4.2",
  "database": "ok",
  "uptime_ms": 1234,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Authentication (`/api/auth`)

### `POST /api/auth/register`

Student self-registration. Public.

Request body:

```json
{
  "username": "student1", "password": "secret-pass-1", "fullName": "Student One",
  "classKey": "42FAK2"
}
```

- `classKey` is optional. Without it the account is `pending` and waits for an
  admin. With a valid [class key](#classrooms-apiclassrooms) it is `approved`
  immediately, the classroom records the student, and the class is enrolled into
  the linked course — a teacher can run a class alone.
- Only a student role is ever created, whatever the body contains.

Response:

```json
{
  "user": { "id": "…", "role": "student", "status": "approved" },
  "viaClass": { "className": "Class 9A", "teacherName": "Olena M." }
}
```

`viaClass` is `null` when no key was used.

- `409 CONFLICT` — username already taken
- `400 INVALID_CLASS_KEY` — a key was typed but is wrong or revoked. Nothing is
  created, so the name stays free and the student can fix the code.
- `400 VALIDATION` — missing/invalid fields

### `POST /api/auth/login`

Verifies credentials and issues a role-scoped bearer token. Public.

Request body:

```json
{ "username": "admin", "password": "admin" }
```

- `200` → `{ "token": "<opaque>", "user": {...} }`
- `401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS` — bad username/password
- `403 PENDING_APPROVAL` / `403 BLOCKED` — account not usable

### `POST /api/auth/password`

Changes the signed-in account's own password. Any role.

```json
{ "currentPassword": "old-pass-1", "newPassword": "new-pass-1" }
```

The current password is required, so a borrowed session cannot lock the owner
out. On success **every** session of that account is ended and a new token is
returned — including the one that made the change, so the client must store it:

```json
{ "token": "…", "user": { … } }
```

- `401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS` — the current password is wrong
- `400 VALIDATION` — missing fields, or a new password under 8 characters

This is what makes the desktop app's "admin password" setting work on a database
that already exists: `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is read once, when the data folder has no
admin yet.

### `POST /api/auth/logout`

Revokes the current session. Requires a valid token. → `204`.

### `GET /api/auth/me`

Returns the logged-in user. Requires a valid token.

```json
{ "user": { "id": "…", "role": "student", "status": "approved", "username": "student1", "fullName": "Student One", "createdAt": "…", "updatedAt": "…" } }
```

## User management (`/api/users`, admin only)

Users are returned without password material: `{ id, role, status, username, fullName, createdAt, updatedAt }`.

### `GET /api/users`

List users. Query: `role` (`admin|teacher|student`), `status`
(`pending|approved|blocked`), `q` (substring on username/fullName).

```json
{ "users": [ { "user": {...} } ] }
```

### `POST /api/users`

Admin creates a teacher (approved immediately). Request body like
`register`; role is always `teacher`.

- `201` → `{ "user": {...} }`
- `409 CONFLICT` — username already taken

### `PATCH /api/users/:id/status`

Admin approves/blocked a student or teacher. Body:
`{ "status": "pending" | "approved" | "blocked" }`. Blocking revokes all
active sessions for that user. Admin accounts are immutable.

- `200` → `{ "user": {...} }`
- `400 INVALID_OPERATION` — target is an admin account
- `404 NOT_FOUND` — no such user

### `DELETE /api/users/:id`

Admin removes a teacher or student (sessions cascade). Admin accounts are
immutable. → `204`.

## Tests (`/api/tests`, admin & teacher)

A test belongs to its creator; admins see everything, teachers only their own.
Questions carry a per-type `payload`:

| Type | Payload |
|------|---------|
| `single_choice` | `{ "options": [{ "key", "text" }], "correct": "key" }` |
| `multiple_choice` | `{ "options": [{ "key", "text" }], "correct": ["key", ...] }` |
| `true_false` | `{ "correct": boolean }` |
| `short_answer` | `{ "accepted": ["Paris", ...] }` |
| `matching` | `{ "pairs": [{ "left", "right" }, ...] }` |

### `GET /api/tests`

List own tests (admin: all). → `{ "tests": [{ id, ownerId, title, description, timeLimitSec, passingPercent, questionCount, createdAt, updatedAt }] }`

### `POST /api/tests`

Create a test. Body:

```json
{
  "title": "Intro quiz",
  "description": "First test",
  "timeLimitSec": 600,
  "passingPercent": 60,
  "questions": [{ "type": "single_choice", "body": "…", "points": 2, "position": 0, "payload": { "options": [{ "key": "a", "text": "A" }, { "key": "b", "text": "B" }], "correct": "a" } }]
}
```

- `201` → full test with questions
- `400 VALIDATION` — any question payload is invalid

### `GET /api/tests/:id`

- `200` → `{ "test": { ...test, "questions": [...] } }`
- `403` — not the owner (non-admin) · `404`

### `PUT /api/tests/:id`

Replaces title/limits and **all** questions (positions must stay 0-based
sequential). Same body and errors as `POST`.

### `DELETE /api/tests/:id`

Removes the test; questions cascade. → `204`.

### `GET /api/tests/:id/export`

The test as a shareable file: `application/json` with a
`content-disposition` filename. No ids, no owner, no timestamps — and the
answer keys, because a colleague has to be able to run it.

```json
{
  "format": "knowledge-testing.test",
  "version": 1,
  "title": "Photosynthesis",
  "description": "Grade 9",
  "timeLimitSec": 600,
  "passingPercent": 60,
  "questions": [{ "type": "true_false", "body": "…", "points": 1, "position": 0, "payload": { "correct": true } }]
}
```

### `POST /api/tests/:id/duplicate`

`201` with the copy: owned by the caller, titled `<original> (copy)`, with fresh
question ids so the two tests are independent. → `403` for another teacher's
test · `404`.

### `POST /api/tests/import`

Reads a file written by the export and creates the test for the caller. The
body is the export document; `format` and `version` must match, positions are
renumbered from the array order, and every question goes through the editor's
own validation.

- `201` → the created test with its questions
- `400 VALIDATION` — not a test file, an unsupported version, no title, no
  questions, or a question that fails validation (the message says which and
  why: `question 2: …`)

### `GET /api/tests/:id/results`

Grade journal for one test, aggregated over **every** session it was run in.
Attempts still in progress are ignored. Both class figures are judged on each
student's last attempt, so a student who improved since the first try is not
counted as a fail; `passRate` is `null` when the test has no pass mark rather
than reading as 0 percent.

```json
{
  "test": { "id": "…", "title": "Photosynthesis", "passingPercent": 50 },
  "students": 2, "submissions": 3, "averagePercent": 50, "passRate": 67,
  "journal": [{ "userId": "…", "username": "ana", "fullName": "Ana K.",
                "attempts": 2, "bestPercent": 100, "lastPercent": 25,
                "lastPassed": false, "averagePercent": 63, "lastSubmittedAt": "…" }],
  "questions": [{ "questionId": "…", "body": "…", "type": "true_false", "points": 1,
                  "answers": 24, "correct": 7, "percent": 29 }]
}
```

`questions` lists every question of the test, including ones nobody has answered
yet (`answers: 0`). → `403` for a student or another teacher · `404`.

## Courses (`/api/courses`, admin & teacher)

A course groups materials (files) and tests, and enrolls students.

### `GET /api/courses`

Own courses (admin: all), each with `materialsCount`, `testsCount`,
`studentsCount`. → `{ "courses": [...] }`

### `POST /api/courses` / `PATCH /api/courses/:id`

Body: `{ "title": "Physics 101", "description": "…" }`. `POST` → `201`.
`GET /api/courses/:id` returns the full course with `materials`, `tests`
(`{ id, title }`), and `students` (`{ id, username, fullName }`).

### `DELETE /api/courses/:id`

Removes the course and its enrollments/links/materials. → `204`.

### Enrollments

- `POST /api/courses/:id/enrollments` with `{ "username": "student1" }` →
  `201` (student must exist with status `approved`); `409 CONFLICT` if already
  enrolled; `400 INVALID_OPERATION` otherwise.
- `DELETE /api/courses/:id/enrollments/:userId` → `204`.

### Attach / detach tests

- `POST /api/courses/:id/tests` with `{ "testId": "…" }` → `201`;
  `409 CONFLICT` when already attached.
- `DELETE /api/courses/:id/tests/:testId` → `204`.

### Materials

- `POST /api/courses/:id/materials?name=notes.pdf` — raw body
  (`Content-Type: application/octet-stream`, no multipart). → `201`
  `{ id, courseId, title, mimeType, sizeBytes, createdAt }`. 100 MiB cap;
  MIME detected from the extension (pdf, images, office, zip, …).
- `GET /api/courses/:id/materials/:materialId/file` — streams the file back
  with its MIME type and `Content-Disposition: attachment`.

## Admin insights (`/api/admin`, admin only)

### `GET /api/admin/stats`

Aggregated DB health and table counts — the admin "System & DB" screen.

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "version": "0.4.2",
    "uptimeMs": 1234,
    "schemaVersion": 4,
    "database": "ok",
    "counts": {
      "users": 5, "admins": 1, "teachers": 1, "students": 3,
      "pendingUsers": 1, "approvedUsers": 4, "blockedUsers": 0,
      "tests": 2, "questions": 7, "courses": 2,
      "enrollments": 4, "materials": 2
    }
  }
}
```

### `GET /api/admin/participants`

Flat course → student participation list (the admin "Participants" screen).

```json
{
  "participants": [
    { "courseId": "…", "courseTitle": "Physics 101", "studentId": "…",
      "username": "student1", "fullName": "Student One",
      "status": "approved", "enrolledAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" }
  ]
}
```

Ordered by course title, then enrollment date.

## Settings (`/api/settings`)

`publicBaseUrl` is the address students open. It is what the join link and the QR
code are built from, so it has to be an address the teacher's own machine cannot
reach on its own: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` and `tauri://localhost` all work on
the teacher's desk and none of them work on a phone. When it is unset, clients
fall back to the origin they are served from, which is exactly the wrong address
in both of the real setups — so the teacher UI says so out loud.

### `GET /api/settings`

Any signed-in role: the teacher's Live tab needs the address to build a link, and
the admin's System screen needs the same value plus what to choose from.

```json
{
  "publicBaseUrl": "http://192.168.1.65:3300",
  "suggestions": ["http://192.168.1.65:3300", "http://172.20.0.14:3300"]
}
```

`publicBaseUrl` is `null` when unset. `suggestions` are the IPv4 addresses this
machine answers on, each with the port the server actually bound. Loopback is
excluded on purpose: offering `127.0.0.1` as a suggestion would be exactly the
wrong advice. IPv6 is left out — a link-local address needs a scope suffix no
phone camera will type in.

### `PATCH /api/settings`

Admin only. Returns the same object as the GET.

```json
{ "publicBaseUrl": "http://192.168.1.65:3300" }
```

- `null` (or an empty string) clears the setting.
- The value is normalised on the way in: case, a default port and a trailing slash
  are dropped, so `http://host:3300/` and `http://host:3300` are the same setting.
- Rejected with `400 VALIDATION` and a message naming the problem: not absolute,
  a scheme other than `http`/`https`, a path, a query, a fragment, credentials in
  the URL, or more than 200 characters. Unknown fields are stripped rather than
  rejected, which is Fastify's default AJV behaviour.

The value lives in `app_meta` under `public_base_url`; a value that is not
currently valid is treated as unset rather than trusted.

## Classrooms (`/api/classrooms`)

A **classroom** is one teacher's group. It exists to hold a six-character key
that a student can register with: with a valid key the account is approved on
the spot, so a teacher can seat a class without an administrator in the room.

The key is drawn from the same alphabet as a join code (`ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789`,
no `0`/`O`/`1`/`I`), so it can be read aloud in class. It accepts only a student
role — the role is fixed in the registration handler, so no key, however it was
obtained, produces anything else.

- The read is authenticated for teachers and admins; a student is refused.
- A teacher sees only their own classes. Another teacher's class answers `403`
  for read, rename, revoke, key and delete alike. An admin sees all.
- Registering through a key **approves** the account; registering without one is
  unchanged (`pending`, waiting for an admin).
- A wrong key and a revoked key both answer `404 NOT_FOUND` with the same
  message, so a key cannot be used to find out which classes existed.

### `GET /api/classrooms`

```json
{
  "classrooms": [
    {
      "id": "…", "ownerId": "…", "name": "Class 9A",
      "key": "42FAK2", "status": "active",
      "courseId": "…", "createdAt": "…", "revokedAt": null,
      "membersCount": 12
    }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/classrooms`

```json
{ "name": "Class 9A", "courseId": "…" }
```

`courseId` is optional (`null` for none). A course the requester does not own is
rejected with `400 VALIDATION` rather than silently ignored — attaching a class
to someone else's course would enrol your students into their roll.

### `GET /api/classrooms/:id`

The class plus the students who arrived through it.

```json
{
  "classroom": { "id": "…", "name": "Class 9A", "membersCount": 1 },
  "members": [
    { "userId": "…", "username": "olena", "fullName": "Olena M.",
      "status": "approved", "joinedAt": "…" }
  ]
}
```

### `PATCH /api/classrooms/:id`

`{ "name": "…", "courseId": "…" }` — rename, or change the linked course. The key
and the existing members are untouched.

### `POST /api/classrooms/:id/revoke`

Sets `status: "revoked"` and stamps `revoked_at`. Nobody can register with the key
afterwards; the accounts that already came in are untouched.

### `POST /api/classrooms/:id/key`

Issues a **new** key and returns it. The old one stops working immediately — this
is the fix for a code that was photographed and left on a wall.

### `DELETE /api/classrooms/:id`

Removes the class and its member rows. The student accounts stay.

### `GET /api/classrooms/preview?key=…`

**Public.** What a key leads to, so the sign-up form can say "Class 9A · Olena M."
before a student types a password. No account is created and nothing is recorded.

```json
{ "preview": { "className": "Class 9A", "teacherName": "Olena M." } }
```

A key holder learns the class name and the teacher's name, and nothing else.

## Live sessions (`/api/sessions`)



A **session** is one live run of a test. A teacher starts it, students join
with a six-character code, answer, and the server grades and stores the paper.

A session snapshots the test's time limit and pass mark at start, so editing
the test mid-run changes nothing for the students already answering. It is
created already `active`; `PATCH` moves it to `paused` or `finished`.

Every entry point that grades or closes a session also sweeps expired
participations: once the time limit has passed, anyone still working is
auto-submitted with zero and the session closes. A teacher who forgets to end
a session therefore costs nobody their attempt.

### Answer payload

Answers are keyed by **question id**, so the shuffled order never matters. One
flat shape per question type:

| Type | Body |
|------|------|
| `single_choice` | `{ "key": "a" }` — the chosen option key |
| `multiple_choice` | `{ "keys": ["a", "c"] }` |
| `true_false` | `{ "boolean": true }` |
| `short_answer` | `{ "text": "oxygen" }` |
| `matching` | `{ "pairs": [{ "left": "Cat", "right": "Animal" }] }` |

Unanswered or malformed answers score zero. Short answers are compared trimmed,
whitespace-collapsed and case-insensitively against the accepted list;
multiple choice is an exact set match, and duplicate keys never collapse into a
match.

### `GET /api/sessions`

Admin & teacher. The teacher's own sessions, newest first; an admin sees every
teacher's.

```json
{ "sessions": [ { "id": "…", "joinCode": "JV8Z9B", "status": "active",
                  "timeLimitSec": 600, "passingPercent": 50,
                  "title": "Mixed quiz", "questionCount": 5,
                  "joinedCount": 2, "submittedCount": 1 } ] }
```

### `POST /api/sessions`

Admin & teacher. Body `{ "testId": "…" }` → `201` with the new session.

- `400 VALIDATION` — the test has no questions yet
- `403 FORBIDDEN` — the test belongs to another teacher

### `GET /api/sessions/:id/participants`

Admin & teacher (owner). The live board: the session plus one row per student.

```json
{ "session": { "id": "…", "status": "active", "…": "…" },
  "participants": [ { "userId": "…", "username": "student1",
                      "fullName": "Student One", "status": "submitted",
                      "score": 6, "percent": 75, "passed": true,
                      "joinedAt": "…", "submittedAt": "…" } ] }
```

`passed` is `null` when the test has no pass mark. `status` is `joined` while
the student is still working, then `submitted` or `auto_submitted`.

### `PATCH /api/sessions/:id`

Admin & teacher (owner). Body `{ "status": "paused" | "active" | "finished" }`
→ `200` with the session. `409 CONFLICT` once it is finished.

### `GET /api/sessions/:id/review`

Admin & teacher (owner). The paper **with** the answer key, for the teacher's
own review screen. Students never receive this payload.

### `POST /api/sessions/join`

Student only. Body `{ "code": "JV8Z9B" }` → `201`. Case and stray spaces are
normalised, so a code read out in class or pasted from a slide works.

```json
{ "participation": { "id": "…", "status": "joined", "questionOrder": ["…"] },
  "session": { "id": "…", "status": "active", "timeLimitSec": 600,
               "passingPercent": 50, "startedAt": "…", "serverNow": "…" },
  "questions": [ { "id": "…", "type": "single_choice", "body": "Capital?",
                   "points": 2, "position": 0,
                   "payload": { "options": [{ "key": "a", "text": "Kyiv" }] } } ] }
```

`serverNow` lets the client correct its clock for the round trip. The payload
carries **no answer key**: `correct` is stripped from choices, `accepted` from
short answers. Re-joining returns the same participation and the same order.

- `404 NOT_FOUND` — no session with that code
- `409 CONFLICT` — the session is finished or paused

### `GET /api/sessions/current`

Student only. The session **still in progress** with the same shape as `join`,
so a reload lands back on the same paper. Only a participation with status
`joined` counts: a finished attempt is history, not something to resume, and the
student home shows it in the results list instead. `404 NOT_FOUND` when nothing
is running.

### `POST /api/sessions/:id/submit`

Student only. Body `{ "answers": { "<questionId>": … } }`.

```json
{ "participation": { "status": "submitted", "…": "…" },
  "result": { "score": 6, "maxScore": 8, "percent": 75, "passed": true } }
```

- `403 FORBIDDEN` — the student never joined
- `409 CONFLICT` — already submitted, or the session is over

### `GET /api/sessions/:id/result`

Student only, their own participation. `409 CONFLICT` before submitting.
Returns the graded paper, each question with `isCorrect`, `pointsAwarded` and
**the answer key**, so the student can learn from the result.

### `GET /api/student/results`

Student only. The student's own finished attempts (status `joined` excluded),
newest first, capped at 50 — the results list on the student home.

```json
{ "results": [{ "participationId": "…", "sessionId": "…", "joinCode": "ABC123",
                "testId": "…", "testTitle": "Photosynthesis", "questionCount": 2,
                "status": "submitted", "score": 4, "maxScore": 4,
                "percent": 100, "passed": true, "submittedAt": "…" }] }
```

`passed` is `null` for a test without a pass mark, which the client shows as a
neutral "Completed" rather than a failure.

### `GET /api/sessions/:id/results.csv`

Admin & teacher (owner). The session as a spreadsheet: `text/csv; charset=utf-8`
with a `content-disposition` filename, a header block (test, join code, status,
start/finish, pass mark), a blank line, then one row per participant with
score, percent, pass and submission time. Fields containing a comma or a quote
are quoted, and the file starts with a UTF-8 BOM so spreadsheet apps read
non-ASCII names correctly.

Because the API authenticates with an `Authorization` header rather than a
cookie, a plain `<a href>` to this endpoint is rejected — the client fetches it
with the token and saves it as a blob.

→ `403` for another teacher's session · `404`

## Reporting

Two endpoints cover what a teacher needs after a run, and they answer different
questions:

| Question | Endpoint |
|----------|----------|
| How did the class do, and which question needs reteaching? | `GET /api/tests/:id/results` — the journal plus per-question difficulty, across every session of that test |
| Give me the sheet for this session | `GET /api/sessions/:id/results.csv` — one row per participant |

Both are teacher-or-admin, scoped to what the caller owns. The journal is what
the app's report screen renders; the CSV is meant to leave the app.

## Logs (`/api/logs`, `/ws/server`)

The same log lines the terminal console prints, for a client that has no
terminal: the desktop console and the admin **Server** tab. Admin only — a log
names who signed in, which accounts exist and what failed.

### `GET /api/logs?since=<seq>`

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "seq": 412,
      "at": "2026-10-07T10:14:22.104Z",
      "level": "info",
      "msg": "request completed",
      "fields": {
        "req": { "method": "GET", "url": "/api/tests", "statusCode": 200 },
        "responseTimeMs": 3
      }
    }
  ],
  "lastSeq": 412
}
```

- `since` returns only lines newer than that sequence number, so a reconnecting
  client asks for exactly what it missed. Omit it for the whole buffer (the last
  500 lines).
- `fields.req` is trimmed to method, url and status; an error keeps its message
  but not its stack; nothing else on the record is dropped.
- **`token=` never appears in a line.** Browsers cannot set headers on a
  WebSocket handshake, so the token travels in the query string and Fastify logs
  the whole URL; the value is replaced with `…` before anything is written.
- Reading the log is itself logged, so the buffer grows between two calls: `since`
  is about sequence numbers, not about how many lines come back.

### `GET /ws/server?token=<token>&since=<seq>`

The live tail over the same buffer. One socket carries both halves: the backlog
the client missed, then each new line as it happens.

| Message | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `{ "type": "backlog", "entries": [ … ], "lastSeq": 412 }` | the lines newer than `since` |
| `{ "type": "entry", "entry": { … } }` | one new line |
| `{ "type": "error", "code": "…", "message": "…" }` | then the socket closes |

Rejections close with a code: `4401` unauthenticated, `4403` not an admin.

## Realtime (`/ws`)


### `GET /ws/sessions/:id`

A WebSocket carrying the session live. Browsers cannot set headers on a
WebSocket handshake, so the token travels in the query string:

| Message | Sent to | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `{ "type": "status", "status": "active", "serverNow": "…" }` | everyone in the session | state on connect and on every change |
| `{ "type": "participants", "participants": [ … ] }` | teachers only | the board, on connect and after every join, submit, pause, resume, finish and timeout sweep |
| `{ "type": "error", "code": "…", "message": "…" }` | the offender | then the socket closes |

Rejections close with a code rather than connecting silently: `4401`
unauthenticated, `4403` not your session (a student who never joined, or a
teacher who does not own it), `4404` unknown session.
