# The three deployment scenarios

The system was imagined around three ways of being used. This is what each one
needs, what works today, and how to check that it works. The plan that closes
the gaps is [Phase 5 of the roadmap](../ROADMAP.md#phase-5--deployment-v050-next).

| Scenario | Where the server runs | Who is in the room | Today |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — school server** | A machine in the school, started by hand or as a service | admin, teacher, students | **Works**, if the teacher opens the web client on the LAN address |
| **B — teacher desktop** | Inside the desktop app, which starts and owns the server | teacher (+ admin when needed) | Client only: the app never starts a server |
| **C — classroom, no admin** | On the teacher's own machine | teacher and students only | Blocked: a student cannot be approved without an admin |

---

## Scenario A — the server on a school machine

This is the one to use today. Everything below works on the current release.

### 1. Build once

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:web                 # → apps/web-client/dist, served by the server
pnpm build:server              # → apps/server/dist/testing-server
```

Or take both from the release page: `testing-server_<version>_linux-x64` and
`web-client_<version>.tar.gz` (unpack the second — the server expects it at
`--webroot`).

### 2. Start it

```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD='choose-a-real-one' \
  ./apps/server/dist/testing-server \
    --port 3300 \
    --data ./data \
    --webroot apps/web-client/dist
```

Expected on screen:

```
{"level":30,...,"msg":"Server listening at http://192.168.1.65:3300"}
[server] listening on http://0.0.0.0:3300 (db: /…/data/app.db)
```

`0.0.0.0` means every interface, which is what lets phones in. If the port is
taken the process exits — pick another one, and remember to use it everywhere
below.


When the terminal shows the LANtern banner, the interactive console is attached:
`help` lists the commands, and `approve olena` lets a student in without leaving
the keyboard. `--no-console` turns it off; a pipe turns it off by itself, which
is what happens when the desktop app starts the server.

### 3. Set the address students can open

Sign in as **admin** → **System & DB** → **Public address**. The server lists the
addresses this machine answers on; pick one (or type your own) and save. The same
value is available without guessing:

```bash
ip -4 route get 1.1.1.1 | rg -o 'src [0-9.]+'     # e.g. src 192.168.1.65
```

From this point on, **use `http://192.168.1.65:3300`, never `localhost`** — a
student's phone cannot open `localhost`, and the teacher's own window
(`tauri://localhost` in the desktop app) is no better. Until this is set, the
teacher's Live tab says so in plain words under the QR code, and the code can
still be typed by hand.

The setting is what goes into the join link, the "Copy join link" button and the
QR code, so it is worth checking once: scan the QR with a phone, or open the
copied link on one. If it opens the app, the address is right.

### 4. Create the accounts

1. Open `http://192.168.1.65:3300` → sign in as **admin** with the password you
   set. Pick the admin role on the sign-in screen.
2. **Users → New teacher** → create the teacher account (this is the only way:
   teachers cannot be created by anyone else).
3. Sign out, sign in as the teacher (pick the teacher role).
4. That is all the admin has to do. Students register themselves in the next
   step, on their own phones.

### 5. Get the student in — with a class key, or an approval

The fastest way, and the one that works when the teacher is alone in the room:
the teacher creates a class and hands out its key.

1. Sign in as the teacher → **Classes** → **Create class** (e.g. `Class 9A`,
   optionally linked to a course) → the key appears, e.g. `42FAK2`.
2. Show the QR code on the projector, or read the key out loud.
3. Each student opens the app (on the LAN address from step 3), the class code is
   filled in from the QR, and the account is created **approved** — the student
   can sign in immediately, and nobody needs to press "Approve".

Without a class key the old path still works:

1. Sign back in as admin → **Users** → the student row shows `pending`.
2. **Approve** (or select several rows and use the bulk button).
3. The student can now sign in. Until this happens the API answers
   `403 PENDING_APPROVAL` — that is the wall scenario C removes.

### 6. The teacher prepares the test

As the teacher: **Tests → New test**, add questions (all five types are
available), then **Live → Start a session → choose the test**. The board shows:

- a six-character code (no ambiguous `0/O`, `1/I` — it gets read out loud);
- **Copy join link** — this is the URL to test;
- **Show QR code** — the QR encodes the same link.

Check the link before going further: the address is printed under the QR code, and
the tab says so in plain words if a phone cannot open it. If it says `localhost`
and no address was set in step 3, the join link is not usable on a phone yet.

### 7. A student takes the test

1. The phone joins the same network (same Wi-Fi, not mobile data).
2. Scan the QR, or open the copied link, or open the address and type the code.
   A student who is not signed in lands on the sign-in screen first; the code
   stays in the address and **prefills itself** once they are in.
3. The paper arrives with the question types the test uses, a confirmation
   before submitting, and — only if the test sets a time limit — a countdown
   corrected against the server's clock.
4. The result shows the score, the pass mark and the correct answers.
5. The teacher's board updates without a refresh; the journal (**Tests →
   Results**) fills in as students finish.

### 8. How to know it worked

- `curl http://192.168.1.65:3300/api/health` → `{"status":"ok","database":"ok",…}`
  from the admin machine, and the same from the phone's browser.
- The student's result screen shows a percentage, and the teacher's board shows
  the same student as `submitted`.
- The journal shows the student with their last percent, and a second test run
  adds a row rather than replacing it.
- **Tests → Results → Print** produces the report for the folder; **Export CSV**
  on the board produces a spreadsheet.

## Scenario B — the teacher desktop app

The desktop app **hosts** the server. The bundle carries it as a sidecar, and the
app starts it, shows its output, and keeps its settings — so a teacher needs
nothing else running and nothing installed on the machine but the app.

### 1. Build both

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:server
pnpm desktop:sidecar        # places the binary where Tauri looks for a sidecar
pnpm --filter @testing-system/desktop build
```

`pnpm desktop:sidecar` is the step that is easy to miss: Tauri looks for
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/binaries/testing-server-<rust triple>` and refuses to
build without it. `scripts/desktop-sidecar.sh` also builds the server unless you
pass `--no-build`.

### 2. First run

1. Open the app. The sign-in screen has a **Server** button next to the language
   menu — the one thing a teacher may need before signing in.
2. The screen says **Stopped** and offers **Start**. Nothing is started silently.
3. If the binary is missing, the Start button is disabled and the screen lists
   every path it looked in, plus the command that produces it. A development
   build without a bundled binary is a normal state, not a crash.
4. **Start** → the console fills with the server's output, the status turns to
   **Running** with a pid, and the sign-in screen can reach the server.

### 3. Settings

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| Port | the API base follows it, so a port change needs no rebuild |
| Data folder | where the database and uploads live; defaults inside the app's data dir |
| Student client folder | `--webroot` — unpack `web-client_<version>.tar.gz` and point at its `dist`, so phones have something to open |
| Server binary | empty means the bundled one; a path is for a development build |
| Admin password | `ADMIN_PASSWORD` at start — used **only** when the data folder has no admin yet |

**Changing the admin password** is a separate pair of fields, and deliberately
so: it calls `POST /api/auth/password`, which ends every session including the
one that made the change. The seed variable is read once, so a second launch
needs the endpoint to move the password at all.

### 4. Stop, restart, close

1. **Stop** → the process is gone; check `ss -ltnp | grep <port>`.
2. **Restart** → the port is free again and a new pid appears.
3. Closing the window stops the server with it. A server left behind would hold
   the port, and the next launch would fail with no clue why.
4. A server that dies on its own — a taken port, a crash — turns the status to
   **Stopped** and reports the exit code.

### 5. Verifying a built bundle

```bash
pnpm desktop:sidecar
NO_STRIP=true pnpm --filter @testing-system/desktop tauri build
```

1. Run the bundle with a **fresh** data folder: first launch shows the defaults
   and a Start button, and Start works.
2. Start → the console fills with `listening on http://0.0.0.0:<port>`.
3. **Open in browser** → the same server; from a phone on the LAN, if the student
   client folder is set.
4. Stop → the process is gone (`ss -ltnp | grep <port>`).
5. Change the port, Restart, and confirm the app still talks to the server — this
   is the check that the API base really follows the setting.
6. A development build without a bundled binary shows the paths it looked in, and
   a readable message instead of a crash.

Rust tests cover the parts that do not need a window:

```bash
cd apps/desktop/src-tauri && cargo test      # HOST=<triple> for the real-server test
```

## Scenario C — a classroom with no admin

### Closed in Phase 5.2

A **classroom with a key**. Before it, the teacher had to sign in as the admin to
approve students by hand — which is the exact thing that breaks when a student
registers five minutes before the lesson.

How it works:

1. The teacher creates a class in their workbench; the app shows a six-character
   key and a QR of the registration link (`?class=KEY`).
2. A student scans it, registers, and is **approved immediately** — the key is
   the approval, scoped to that class and revocable.
3. Optionally the classroom is linked to a course, and everyone who arrives
   through the key is enrolled in it.
4. The teacher sees who came in through the key, and can revoke or regenerate it.

### How to verify it

- Register with a valid key → the account is usable right away, no admin involved.
- Register with a wrong or revoked key → a clear error, and the account is still
  `pending` (nothing about the old flow changes).
- Revoke a key → the next registration with it is refused; existing students keep
  working.
- A teacher cannot see, revoke or delete another teacher's class, and a class key
  never grants teacher or admin rights anywhere.
- Automated: `apps/server/tests/classrooms.test.ts` (key generation, approve /
  reject / revoke, ownership, auto-enrolment) and a browser check of the register
  screen with and without a key.

## How to develop and verify all of this

**Order of work** — each package ends with something you can try by hand:

| Package | Ends with | Verify by |
|---|---|---|
| 5.1 Reachability | a QR that a phone opens | type an address into settings, read the QR with a phone |
| 5.2 Classroom key | a student in without an admin | register with the key on a second device |
| 5.3 Console | logs you can read, and commands that act | `--no-console` off, type `help`, then `status` |
| 5.4 Desktop host | the server inside the app | build the bundle, start it, open it from a phone |
| 5.5 Verifiability | the runbooks above | re-run this document top to bottom |

**Automated checks** (no browser needed):

```bash
pnpm typecheck                 # all three packages
cd apps/server && bun test     # server unit + integration
pnpm --filter @testing-system/web-client test
```

**Browser checks**: drive the built client with headless Firefox over WebDriver
BiDi (the harness used while building this). It reports, per screen and width:
horizontal scroll, touch targets under 30px, unnamed controls, untranslated
keys — plus one happy path per role. Screenshots come out of the same run, so a
visual pass is two minutes rather than a manual click-through.

**Manual pass before calling a package done** — run the relevant scenario above
end to end on a real phone, not on the same machine.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| QR scans but the page will not open | no public address is set, so the link says `localhost` or `tauri://` | admin → System & DB → Public address, pick the LAN address, save; the tab warns about this on its own |
| Phone cannot reach the server at all | firewall, or a different network | allow TCP 3300; both devices on the same Wi-Fi |
| `403 PENDING_APPROVAL` | the student registered without a class key and is not approved yet | register with the teacher's class key, or admin → Users → Approve |
| `403 FORBIDDEN` on an action | the signed-in role is not the one the action needs | teachers cannot manage users; only admins can |
| The board does not update | the WebSocket could not be opened | it falls back to polling every 4s; check for a proxy in between |
| The countdown looks wrong on a phone | device clock drift | the deadline is corrected against the server on join |
| Server exits at start, `EADDRINUSE` | the port is taken | another port, in the command and in the join link |
